The Decision MCP Server bridges IBM ODM with modern AI assistants and orchestration platforms.  
It enables you to:
- Expose decision services as tools for AI assistants
- Automate decisions dynamically in workflows
- Integrate easily with Watson Orchestrate, Claude Desktop, and Cursor AI
- Centralize and expose business logic to end users and bots

---

## Features

- **Tool Integration:** Add and invoke ODM decision services as tools
- **Decision Storage:** Manage resources with a local storage system
- **Authentication:** Zen API Key, Basic Auth, and OpenID Connect
- **Multi-Platform:** Works with Watson Orchestrate, Claude Desktop, and Cursor AI

---

## Quickstart: Claude Desktop Integration

### Part 1: Installation & Configuration

#### Prerequisites

- Git
- Python 3.13+
- uv
- Claude Desktop ([Download](https://claude.ai/download))
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional, for Step 2: local ODM deployment)

#### Step 1: Install Git, Python and uv

- Install Git (you can keep the default options)
- Install Python 3.13 or later
- Install uv:
  - on macOS: 
    ```shell
    brew install uv
    ```
  - on Windows: 
    - in Powershell, run the command described in [installing uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
    - once `uv` is installed, open a new Powershell window/tab, and run the command below:
      ```powershell
      uvx --from git+https://github.com/DecisionsDev/decision-mcp-server decision-mcp-server
      ``` 
    - wait for `uvx` to complete downloading all the Python packages required by Decision MCP server
    - you can then safely stop the `uvx` command line

- Verify your Python and `uv` installation:
  ```bash
  uv python list
  ```

#### Step 2: Run ODM Locally (Optional)

If you want to use a local ODM instance for development or testing, 

- clone this repository,
- and run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
  If the command is successful, you should see:
    ```
    upload_materials  | ✅ ODM Ready for MCP Server
    upload_materials exited with code 0
    ```

- Once the containers are running, the ODM web consoles are available at [http://localhost:9060](http://localhost:9060) using the default credentials:

  - **Username:** `odmAdmin`
  - **Password:** `odmAdmin`

This ODM instance will be available for the MCP Server, pre-populated with sample data for testing and development purposes.

#### Step 3: Configure Claude Desktop
1. Open Claude Desktop Settings:
   - On macOS, click the Claude menu in the top menu bar and select **Settings**.
   - On Windows, access **Settings** from the Claude application.

2. Navigate to the **Developer** tab and click **Edit Config**:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

3. Add the following configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "decision-mcp-server": {
         "command": "uvx",
         "args": [
           "--from",
           "git+https://github.com/DecisionsDev/decision-mcp-server",
           "decision-mcp-server",
           "--url",      "http://localhost:9060/res",
           "--username", "odmAdmin",
           "--password", "odmAdmin"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. Restart Claude Desktop:

    Simply closing the window is not enough, Claude Desktop must be stopped and restarted:
    - on macOS: Claude > Quit
    - on Windows: File > Exit

Refer to the [Configuration Parameters Table](#configuration-parameters-table) for a list of supported environment variables and CLI arguments.

### Part 2: Demo Walkthrough

This walkthrough demonstrates how Claude Desktop can interact with IBM ODM Developer Edition through the Decision MCP Server. The scenario showcases three decision services:

1. **Vacation Policy Decision Service** – Computes vacation days based on company policy.
2. **Beauty Advice Decision Service** – Provides personalized beauty recommendations.
3. **Agent Miniloan Service** – Assess loan requests.

#### Step-by-Step Scenario

##### 1. Claude Connects to ODM

Once Claude Desktop is configured with the MCP Server, it automatically connects to the ODM Developer Edition. The MCP Server retrieves and exposes the available decision services as Claude tools.

✅ To see all the tools listed in Claude Desktop, proceed as follows:
- first click the settings icon, and you should see:
![Screenshot showing Claude tools](docs/claude-mcp-tools.png)

- then click `decision-mcp-server`, and you should see:
![Screenshot showing Claude tools](docs/claude-mcp-tools-details.png)

##### 2. User Starts a Conversation

The user initiates a conversation in Claude with a natural language request:

> **User:** "I need to compute my vacation."

Claude recognizes this intent and activates the `computeVacation` tool.

##### 3. Claude Gathers Required Inputs

Claude prompts the user for the necessary information:

> **Claude:** "Can you provide your employee ID and hiring date?"

The user responds with:

> **User:** "Employee ID: 12345, Hiring Date: 2018-06-01"

##### 4. ODM Decision Service is Invoked

Claude sends the input to the ODM decision service via the MCP Server. The service processes the request and returns a result, such as:

> **ODM Response:** `{  "timeoffDays": "33 days per year" }`

Claude interprets and presents the result:

> **Claude:** "Based on your hiring date, you are entitled to 33 time-off days."

##### 5. User Tries Another Input

The user can experiment with different inputs:

> **User:** "What if I was hired on 2000-01-01?"

Claude reuses the tool, sends the new input, and returns the updated result.

##### 6. Switching to Beauty Advice

The user can now try a different tool:

> **User:** "Can I get some beauty advice?"

Claude activates the `beauty_advice` tool and may ask follow-up questions (e.g., skin type, preferences) before invoking the ODM service and returning personalized recommendations.

#### Demo Notes

- This scenario demonstrates how Claude can dynamically interact with multiple decision services.
- The tools are exposed automatically by the MCP Server based on the ODM configuration.
- You can extend this setup with additional decision services or integrate it into broader workflows using Watson Orchestrate.

## Configuration

### 1. ODM Container Environments & Authentication

Depending on your IBM ODM deployment, use the appropriate authentication/authorization method:

#### 1.1. **ODM on Cloud Pak for Business Automation**
- **Environment:** Cloud Pak for Business Automation (CP4BA)
- **Authentication:** Zen API Key
  - **CLI:** `--zenapikey <your-zen-api-key>`
  - **Env:** `ZENAPIKEY=<your-zen-api-key>`

#### 1.2. **ODM on Kubernetes**
- **Environment:** IBM ODM deployed on Kubernetes (including OpenShift)
- **Authentication:**  
  - **Basic Auth:**  
    - **CLI:** `--username <user> --password <pass>`
    - **Env:** `ODM_USERNAME=<user> ODM_PASSWORD=<pass>`
  - **OpenID Connect (using Client Secret):**
    - **CLI:** `--client-id <CLIENT_ID> --client-secret <CLIENT_SECRET> --token-url <TOKEN_URL>` and optionally `--scope <scope>`
    - **Env:** `CLIENT_ID=<client_id> CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret> TOKEN_URL=<URL>` and optionally `SCOPE=<scope>`
  - **OpenID Connect (using Private Key JWT):**
    - **CLI:** `--client-id <CLIENT_ID> --pkjwt-key-path <PRIVATE_KEY_PATH> --pkjwt-cert-path <CERT_PATH> --token-url <TOKEN_URL>` and optionally `--scope <scope>` and `--pkjwt-key-password <PASSWORD>` if the private key is password-protected.
    - **Env:** `CLIENT_ID=<client_id> PKJWT_KEY_PATH=<private_key_path> PKJWT_CERT_PATH=<cert_path> TOKEN_URL=<URL>` and optionally `SCOPE=<scope>` and `PKJWT_KEY_PASSWORD=<password>` if the private key is password-protected.
    >**Note:** Both a private key and its certificate are required for PKJWT authentication. The private key is used for signing the JWT (Json Web Token), while the certificate is used for computing the x5t thumbprint. A password-protected private key can be used. In that case, the password must be specified.

#### 1.3. **ODM for Developers (Docker/Local)**
- **Environment:** Local Docker or Developer Edition
- **Authentication:** Basic Auth
  - **CLI:** `--username <user> --password <pass>`
  - **Env:** `ODM_USERNAME=<user> ODM_PASSWORD=<pass>`

### 2. Different authentication types: Console vs Runtime

The Decision MCP Server actually communicates with two different ODM components/servers:
- the RES console
- the Decision Server Runtime

When these two ODM components are configured to use different authentication types, the Decision MCP Server can be configured accordingly by:
- specifying all the parameters required to authenticate to both ODM components,
- and using the additional parameters below:
  - **CLI:** `--console-auth-type <console_auth_type> --runtime-auth-type <runtime_auth_type>`
  - **Env:** `CONSOLE_AUTH_TYPE=<console_auth_type> RUNTIME_AUTH_TYPE=<runtime_auth_type>`

    > where `<console_auth_type>` and `<runtime_auth_type>` must take one of the values below:
    > | auth_type | Description.                                             |
    > | ----------|--------------------------------------------------------- |
    > | BASIC     | basic authentication                                     |
    > | ZEN       | Zen API Key authentication.                              |
    > | SECRET    | OpenID Connect authentication with a Client Secret       |
    > | PKJWT     | OpenID Connect authentication with a Private Key (PKJWT) |
    > | NONE      | No authentication/authorization                          |

> Note: 
> - Decision MCP Server does not support to use the same authentication type with different credentials
> - for instance, Basic Auth with two different usernames (one for the RES console, and one for the Runtime)
> - This is not supported.
> - The unique user/service account must be configured to have access to both ODM components (see [3. Authorization](#3-authorization) below).

### 3. Authorization

#### 3.1. ODM on Cloud Pak for Business Automation

If ODM is deployed in IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation, the user/service account used must have a role assigned that grants the Zen permissions below in order to be able to access both the RES Console and the Decision Server Runtime:

  | Zen permissions |
  |-----------------|
  | ODM - Monitor decision services in Decision Server |
  | ODM - Execute decision services in Decision Server |

Read more in [Managing user permissions](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/25.0.0?topic=access-managing-user-permissions).

#### 3.2. ODM on Kubernetes

If ODM is deployed on Kubernetes, the user/service account used must have the roles below:

  | ODM roles     |
  |---------------|
  | resMonitors   |
  | resExecutors  |

#### 3.3. ODM on Cloud

If ODM is deployed in the managed offering ODM on Cloud, the role below must be assigned to the user/service account used (for the suitable environment (Development / Test / Production)):

  | ODM on Cloud role |
  |-------------------|
  | Monitor           |

Read more in [Creating and managing service accounts](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/dbaoc?topic=access-creating-managing-service-accounts).


### 4. Secure connection

#### 4.1. Server certificate

To establish a SSL/TLS secure connection to the server, the Decision MCP server must have access to the certificate used to sign the server certificate.

If a public CA certificate was used to sign the server certificate, the Decision MCP server can find it among the system trusted certificates.

If this is a self-signed certificate, it can be specified :
  - **CLI:** `--ssl-cert-path <certificate_filename>`
  - **Env:** `SSL_CERT_PATH=<certificate_filename>`

Alternatively, in dev/test environments, the authenticity of the server can be ignored:
  - **CLI:** `--verifyssl "False"`
  - **Env:** `VERIFY_SSL="False"`

#### 4.2. mTLS (mutual TLS)

The server can be configured to check the authenticity of the clients that try to establish a secure connection.

In that case, the Decision MCP server (which acts as a client), must be configured with both a private key and its related certificate (and the server must be configured to trust the clients presenting that certificate when establishing a secure connection).

The parameters below can be specified:
  - **CLI:** `--mtls-key-path <PRIVATE_KEY_PATH> --mtls-cert-path <CERT_PATH>` and optionally `--mtls-key-password <PASSWORD>` if the private key is password-protected.
  - **Env:** `MTLS_KEY_PATH=<private_key_path> MTLS_CERT_PATH=<cert_path>` and optionally `MTLS_KEY_PASSWORD=<password>` if the private key is password-protected.

### Decision MCP Server Configuration File          

You can configure the MCP server for clients like Claude Desktop or Cursor AI using a JSON configuration file, which can contain both environment variables and command-line arguments.

**Tips:**
- Use CLI arguments for quick overrides or non-sensitive parameters.
- Use environment variables for secrets.
- You can mix both methods if needed. CLI arguments override environment variables.

The example below shows a typical use-case where the sensitive information (here the password) is passed as an environment variable (so that it does not show in the arguments of the process), and the other parameters are passed as CLI arguments:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "decision-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/DecisionsDev/decision-mcp-server",
        "decision-mcp-server",
        "--url", "https://odm-res-console-url",
        "--ssl-cert-path", "certificate-file",
        "--username", "your-username"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ODM_PASSWORD": "odmAdmin"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The examples below demonstrate various use cases depending on the type of deployment (dev/test or production), and environments (CloudPak, ...).

---
#### Example 1: Basic Auth for Local Development

For local development and testing, use the Basic Auth.

```json
"args": [
  "--from",
  "git+https://github.com/DecisionsDev/decision-mcp-server",
  "decision-mcp-server",
  "--url", "http://localhost:9060/res",
  "--username", "odmAdmin"
],
"env": {
  "ODM_PASSWORD": "odmAdmin"
}
```

---
#### Example 2: For Cloud Pak (Zen API Key)

For production deployments on the Cloud Pak, use the Zen API Key.

```json
"args": [
  "--from",
  "git+https://github.com/DecisionsDev/decision-mcp-server",
  "decision-mcp-server",
  "--url",           "https://odm-res-console-url",
  "--ssl-cert-path", "certificate-file",
  "--username",      "YOUR_ZENUSERNAME"
],
"env": {
  "ZENAPIKEY": "YOUR_ZEN_API_KEY"
}
```

---
#### Example 3: OpenID Connect

For production deployments on other environments than the Cloud Pak, you may use OpenID Connect if ODM is configured to use it.

The Decision MCP Server can authenticate to ODM configured with OpenID Connect, using the Client Credentials flow.

Two authentication variants are possible:

1) Using a Client Secret
```json
"args": [
  "--from",
  "git+https://github.com/DecisionsDev/decision-mcp-server",
  "decision-mcp-server",
  "--url",           "https://odm-res-console-url",
  "--runtime-url",   "https://odm-runtime-url",
  "--ssl-cert-path", "certificate-file",
  "--token-url",     "https://your-openid-connect_provider-token-endpoint-url",
  "--scope",         "the_scope_to_be_used_for_client_credentials"
],
"env": {
  "CLIENT_ID":      "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "CLIENT_SECRET":  "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
}
```

2) Using a Private Key (PKJWT)
```json
"args": [
  "--from",
  "git+https://github.com/DecisionsDev/decision-mcp-server",
  "decision-mcp-server",
  "--url",           "https://odm-res-console-url",
  "--runtime-url",   "https://odm-runtime-url",
  "--ssl-cert-path", "certificate-file",
  "--token-url",     "https://your-openid-connect_provider-token-endpoint-url",
  "--scope",         "the_scope_to_be_used_for_client_credentials"
],
"env": {
  "CLIENT_ID":       "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "PKJWT_KEY_PATH":  "PKJWT_PRIVATE_KEY_FILENAME",
  "PKJWT_CERT_PATH": "PKJWT_CERTIFICATE_FILENAME"
}
```

---
#### Example 4: mTLS (Mutual TLS) Authentication

The Decision MCP Server also supports mTLS (mutual TLS) authentication, which secure the SSL connection further.

When authorization is required (to assess the right to access to the service (RES console and/or Decision Service Runtime)), mTLS must be complemented with another means of authentication/authorization, for instance with basic auth in the example below:

```json
"args": [
  "--from",
  "git+https://github.com/DecisionsDev/decision-mcp-server",
  "decision-mcp-server",
  "--url",           "https://odm-res-console-url",
  "--runtime-url",   "https://odm-runtime-url",
  "--ssl-cert-path", "certificate-file",
  "--username",      "SERVICE_ACCOUNT"
],
"env": {
  "PASSWORD":       "SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD",
  "MTLS_KEY_PATH":  "MTLS_PRIVATE_KEY_FILENAME",
  "MTLS_CERT_PATH": "MTLS_CERTIFICATE_FILENAME"
}
```

---
#### Example 5: Different Authentication Types: Console vs Runtime

The example below shows how to configure the Decision MCP Server when:
- the RES console uses OpenID Connect with PKJWT, and
- the Decision Server Runtime has been configured to use mTLS and have the authorization disabled

```json
"args": [
  "--from",
  "git+https://github.com/DecisionsDev/decision-mcp-server",
  "decision-mcp-server",
  "--url",           "https://odm-res-console-url",
  "--runtime-url",   "https://odm-runtime-url",
  "--ssl-cert-path", "certificate-file",

  "--console-auth-type", "PKJWT",
  "--token-url",         "https://your-openid-connect_provider-token-endpoint-url",
  "--scope",             "the_scope_to_be_used_for_client_credentials",

  "--runtime-auth-type", "NONE"
],
"env": {
  "CLIENT_ID":       "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "PKJWT_KEY_PATH":  "PKJWT_PRIVATE_KEY_FILENAME",
  "PKJWT_CERT_PATH": "PKJWT_CERTIFICATE_FILENAME",

  "MTLS_KEY_PATH":   "PRIVATE_KEY_FILENAME",
  "MTLS_CERT_PATH":  "CERTIFICATE_FILENAME"
}
```

### Ruleset Properties for the Decision MCP Server

You can configure how your Decision Server rulesets are exposed as MCP tools by setting specific ruleset properties in IBM ODM. These properties control whether a ruleset is available as a tool and how it's presented to AI assistants.

#### Adding Ruleset Properties

You can add ruleset properties using any of these methods:

1. **In Rule Designer:**
   - Open your ruleset project
   - Right-click on the ruleset > Properties > Ruleset Properties
   - Add the desired properties with their values
   - Save and deploy your ruleset

2. **In Decision Center:**
   - Open the ruleset > Settings > Properties
   - Add the desired properties with their values
   - Save and deploy your ruleset

3. **In Decision Server Console:**
   - Log in to the Decision Server Console
   - Navigate to Explorer > Rulesets
   - Select your ruleset
   - Click on the "Properties" tab
   - Add the desired properties with their values
   - Click "Save"

#### MCP Configuration Properties
Property | Description | Default |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
`agent.enabled`     | Controls whether the ruleset is exposed as an MCP tool                   | `false`                                  |
`agent.name`        | Customizes the name of the tool as exposed to AI assistants              | Name of the decision operation. Display Name in the Decision Server console. |
`agent.description` | Overrides the default description of the ruleset when exposed as a tool  | Description of the decision operation     |

#### Example

```
agent.enabled=true
agent.description=This tool calculates vacation days based on employee tenure and position
```

**Note:** After updating ruleset properties, you need to redeploy the ruleset for changes to take effect.

### Fine-Tuning Tool Descriptions for LLMs

When exposing decision services as tools for LLMs, the quality of the tool descriptions significantly impacts how effectively the LLM can utilize them. Here are best practices for optimizing your tool descriptions:

#### Detailed Service Descriptions

Having detailed descriptions of what a service does and the expected parameter values can guide the LLM to be more precise when triggering tools.

##### Example:

```
Allow to compute the beauty advise. This takes as parameters:
- age: should be between 0 and 110
- sex: Value should be Male or Female
- skin color: should be one of these values: Dark, Ebony, Ivory, Light, Medium or Unknown
- hair color: should be one of these values: Black, Blonde, Brown, Gray, Red, White or Unknown

For the hair color or skin color, you can suggest possible values.
```

This detailed description helps the LLM understand:
- The purpose of the service ("compute beauty advice")
- Valid parameter ranges and constraints
- Acceptable enumeration values
- Guidance on how to handle certain parameters

#### Enhancing OpenAPI with Swagger Annotations

When service descriptions alone aren't sufficient to fully describe the API signature, you can augment your OpenAPI generation by adding Swagger annotations to your Java classes:

```java
package miniloan;

import io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations.media.Schema;

/**
 * This class models a borrower.
 * A borrower is created with a name, a credit score, and a yearly income.
 */
@Schema(description = "This class models a borrower. A borrower is created with a name, a credit score, and a yearly income.")
public class Borrower {
    @Schema(description = "The name of the borrower.")
    private String name;
    
    @Schema(description = "The credit score of the borrower.", format = "int32")
    private int creditScore;
    
    @Schema(description = "The yearly income of the borrower.", format = "int32")
    private int yearlyIncome;

    
    public Borrower() {
    }
}
```

These annotations provide:
- Detailed descriptions for each field
- Format specifications
- Additional metadata that can be included in the generated OpenAPI specification

> **Note:** It is not necessary to package the Swagger JAR file in the XOM (Execution Object Model) as it is already part of the IBM ODM product. You can use the annotations directly without adding additional dependencies to your project.

By combining rich service descriptions with properly annotated model classes, you can create tool definitions that LLMs can understand and use with high precision, reducing errors and improving the quality of interactions.
